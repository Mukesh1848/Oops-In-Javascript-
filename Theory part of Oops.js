Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. 
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. 
  
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.

Class
Objects
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Dynamic Binding
Message Passing

Class

The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. 
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, 
which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. 
For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties 
like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.

A Class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions.
Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables together these data members and member 
functions define the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.
In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage, etc and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed, etc.


Object

An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated
but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
